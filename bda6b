EXPERIMENT-6 (B)

AIM:Write the following Pig Scripts on Unstructured Text Data

i) Wordcount ( Tokenize, Flatten, GroupBY)
ii) Top5 words as per the count in descending order
(SortBY, LIMIT)
iii) Find the total number of words whose count is > 5
   
INPUT TEXT DATA:
input.txt
I Know Your Failure 
But I Wont Tell You
I Know Your Success
But I Wont Tell You
I Know Everything About You 
But I Wont Tell You
I Am Vikramaditya
I Am No God
But Not One Of You

i) Wordcount ( Tokenize, Flatten, GroupBY)

SCRIPT:
lines = LOAD 'input.txt'  as (line:chararray);
words = FOREACH lines GENERATE FLATTEN(TOKENIZE($0));
wordg  = GROUP words BY $0;
wc = FOREACH wordg GENERATE group, COUNT(words) as (count:long);
DUMP wc;


OUTPUT:




ii) Top5 words as per the count in descending order (SortBY, LIMIT):
SCRIPT:
lines = LOAD â€˜input.txt'  as (line:chararray);
words = FOREACH lines GENERATE FLATTEN(TOKENIZE($0));
wordg  = GROUP words BY $0;
wc = FOREACH wordg GENERATE group, COUNT(words) as (count:long);
st = ORDER wc BY $1 DESC;
l = LIMIT st 5;
DUMP l;





OUTPUT:


iii) Find the total number of words whose count is > 5:

SCRIPT:
lines = LOAD 'wc.txt' using TextLoader() as (line:chararray);
words = FOREACH lines GENERATE FLATTEN(TOKENIZE($0));
wordg = GROUP words BY $0;
wc = FOREACH wordg GENERATE group, COUNT(words) as (count:long);
f = FILTER wc by count>5;
DUMP f;


OUTPUT:
