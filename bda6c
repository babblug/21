Write the following Pig Scripts on Structured Data

Let us consider the input record format as Emp(name, age, dept, salary)
i) Find names of all employees whose is age is less than 36 and greater than
25
ii) Find the number of employees in each department
iii) Find the number of employee whose salary is greater 40000 and name starts
With ‘p’
iv) Find the number of employees whose salary is greater than the average salary
of all employees

INPUT TEXT DATA:
Emp.txt
Balu,25,it,100000
meera,30,sales,50000
sai,45,business,25000
edukondalu,20,sales,90000
laskhman,34,business,50000

i) Find names of all employees whose is age is less than 36 and greater than 25

SCRIPT:
lines = LOAD 'Emp.csv' USING PigStorage(',') as (name:chararray, age:int, dept:chararray, salary:long);
temprec = FILTER lines BY age >25 and age <36;
DUMP temprec;

OUTPUT:


ii) Find the number of employees in each department
SCRIPT:
lines = LOAD 'Emp.csv' USING PigStorage(',') as (name:chararray, age:int, dept:chararray, salary:long);
deptgrp = GROUP lines BY dept;
numofemployees = FOREACH deptgrp GENERATE $0, COUNT($1);
DUMP numofemployees;



OUTPUT:


iii) Find the number of employee whose salary is greater 40000 and name starts with ‘p’
SCRIPT:
lines = LOAD 'Emp.csv' USING PigStorage(',') as (name:chararray, age:int, dept:chararray, salary:long);
slf = FILTER lines BY $3>40000 AND STARTSWITH($0,’j’);
grouping = GROUP slf ALL;
res = FOREACH grouping GENERATE COUNT($1);
DUMP res;

OUTPUT:


iv) Find the number of employees whose salary is greater than the average salary of all employees

SCRIPT:
lines = LOAD 'Emp.csv' USING PigStorage(',') as (name:chararray, age:int, dept:chararray, salary:long);
grouped = GROUP lines ALL;
avgsal = FOREACH grouped  GENERATE AVG(lines.salary) as (a:long);
temp= FILTER lines BY salary>avgsal.a;
grp = GROUP temp ALL;
res = FOREACH grp GENERATE COUNT($1);
DUMP res;

OUTPUT:
