AIM: Explain the steps of Hive Installation  and Hive Modes of Execution
 
DESCRIPTION:

1.Installation :
 Install jdk version using this command (because hive works with java 8 version only)
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
set environment variables in .bashrc file
Download hive-3.1.2 file from https://downloads.apache.org/hive/hive-3.1.2/
Extract the file using this command
tar xf apache-hive-3.1.2-bin.tar.gz
set environment variables in .bashrc file
nano .bashrc
source .bashrc
create below files
sudo mkdir /user/
sudo mkdir /user/hive
sudo mkdir /user/hive/warehouse
Change permissions 
sudo chmod 777 -R /user/hive/warehouse/
Initiating Apache Derby Schema after downloading and extracting files
hive/home/bin/schematool -dbTYpe derby -initSchema

2. Hive Modes Of Execution:
    Depending on the size of Hadoop data nodes, Hive can operate in two different modes:
Local mode
Map-reduce mode
Use Local mode when:
Hadoop is installed under the pseudo mode, possessing only one data node
The data size is smaller and limited to a single local machine
Users expect faster processing because the local machine contains smaller datasets.
Use Map Reduce mode when:    
Hadoop has multiple data nodes, and the data is distributed across these different nodes
Users must deal with more massive data sets
